        <p>Think about going to school. While most companies hiring a programmer will care more
            about your skills
            than the college you went to or your grades, it greatly helps to have a college degree to point to. You
            will learn more efficiently than if you teach yourself, all while getting expert guidance from your
            teachers (and maybe your friends).[7]
            There are often scholarships and grants available to those doing degrees in this field. Don't feel
            intimidated by the price tag of a degree: it is possible!</p>
