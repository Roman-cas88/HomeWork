            <p>Bitcoin (BTC) extended its stint in the red during today’s session, as the token was on the cusp of
                falling below $21,000.
                Following a high of $22,213.48 to start the week, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $21,012.48 in
                today’s session.
                The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency fall to its lowest level since last Monday, July 18,
                when prices were trading at a significant price floor.
                This support point is the $20,600 level, which typically has been the last line of defense from bulls,
                preventing bearish sentiment from taking bitcoin below $20,000.
                Looking at the chart, it looks as though we could be set to see BTC once again collide with this floor,
                as downside pressure seems to be gaining momentum.
                The relative strength index (RSI) is also tracking below 50, which usually indicates that bears are
                currently dictating price movement.</p>
